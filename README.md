# coffee_machine.cpp
A C++ console application demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Users can select coffee options, make payments, and check resource availability while managing the coffee machine's functionality.


# Coffee Machine Simulator

This Coffee Machine Simulator is a console-based application written in C++ that showcases the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The program allows users to interact with a virtual coffee machine, selecting coffee options, making payments, and checking resource availability.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**: The project employs OOP concepts, including classes, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Coffee Menu**: Users can choose from a selection of coffee items: Espresso, Latte, and Cappuccino.
- **Payment System**: Supports payment with various coin denominations (₹1, ₹2, ₹5, ₹10).
- **Resource Management**: The simulator checks for sufficient resources (water, milk, coffee) before preparing the selected coffee.
- **User Interaction**: The program provides a simple, intuitive menu interface for user input.
- **Status Reporting**: Users can view the current status of resources and total earnings of the coffee machine.

## OOP Concepts Used

- **Classes and Objects**: The project utilizes multiple classes, such as `MenuItem`, `Menu`, `CoffeeMaker`, `MoneyMachine`, and `SufficientResources`, to represent different components of the coffee machine.
- **Encapsulation**: Data members of classes are kept private and accessed through public methods.
- **Composition**: Classes are composed of other classes, allowing for organized and manageable code.
- **Abstraction**: Complex functionalities are hidden behind simple interfaces, providing a user-friendly experience.
